# **App Name**: ThreadPilot

## Core Features:

- Content Extraction & Processing: Extracts and processes content from various sources like direct text input, URLs, and uploaded files (PDF, DOCX), while preserving basic formatting (bold, links).
- AI-Powered Thread Generation: Uses OpenAI's GPT models to intelligently chunk content into cohesive social media threads. Generates compelling opening/closing tweets and adds connectors to maintain narrative coherence.
- Thread Preview & Editing: Offers a side-by-side preview of the original content versus the generated thread, allowing users to edit individual tweets, monitor character counts, and visualize the thread flow.
- Platform-Specific Export Options: Enables users to copy individual tweets or export entire threads in formats optimized for Twitter and LinkedIn.
- Optimal Timing Suggestions: Analyzes the pasted data and uses a tool to suggest the best times for posting the threads on social media based on the target audience and content type.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Strong Blue (#29ABE2), associated with trust and professionalism, important for a tool offering expert functionality.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F2F5), provides a neutral backdrop to focus on the text-heavy content.
- Accent color: Muted purple (#8E44AD), adds a touch of uniqueness and modernism without overwhelming the interface.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines, and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text; to provide a modern and readable interface.
- Use simple, clear icons from a set like Phosphor or Remix Icon to represent actions and settings, ensuring they are intuitive and match the modern design.
- Implement a clean, sectioned layout that clearly divides the content input, thread generation, preview, and optimization panels, focusing user attention on the main workflow.
- Incorporate subtle animations on thread generation and during preview changes, using easing and transitions to provide feedback without being distracting.
